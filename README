This syntax script will colorize UN/EDIFACT messages.
All formatting errors are reported with the "Error" highlighting.

Hooks are provided for extensibility (including EDIFACT messages in another syntax) and to define a more specific syntax (coloring known tags, checking segment definitions with mandatory/conditionnal data...).
